# Temperature-sendor
We will use tinckercad ,thinkspeak and app to diplay temperature using arduino


##First creating the circuit 
components : 
            Arduino Uno 3
           i)  Wifi module
          ii) 2 resistor
         iii) Temperature senor and wires
##Second creating api key using thingspeak
             i)create a channel copy apik key and include it in the dashboard code of tinkercad and some code
##third Creating an application using mit app inventor 
             i)Create an interface 
            ii)and backened code 
            iii)scan the qr to dwonlaod the app
(Note - they are all for free no need to donwload and everything is online)
